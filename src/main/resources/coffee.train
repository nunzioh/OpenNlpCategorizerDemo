COFFEE I just ordered 2 more cans of this. I can completely and honestly say, this is one the finest cups of coffee I have ever had !!! I made an Aeropress and enjoyed this with a Ashton VSG cigar and I was in heaven !!!!!! 
COFFEE This is one of the best medium roast blends I've ever had. Balance is perfect; a lot of chocolate notes but not cloying. Extremely smooth, but not bland - you can pick out a lot of nut and slight fruit flavors. Body is exactly what the roast should be - I brewed this in a Chemex & I found the mouthfeel perfect. I'm advised that they are changing the name of this blend from B-Ville to "1861." Works for me - it's the perfect cup of Joe one would want to have before the bloodiest war in American history commenced.
COFFEE Exactly what I needed! It has an unbelievable smoothness and balance - I can drink either black or with cream -either way it has a very distinct finish without being overwhelming. My favorite! 
COFFEE I've been going coffee crazy lately and have been sampling countless varieties. That being said, this is a coffee I keep going back to. It has a nice creamy, rich and full body with lots of caramel chocolate earthy goodness. Put a donut into the equation and WOW! It's good with just about anything anytime though.

BEER The Hop Happy is a robust APA. The beer pours a clear copper with thin white head that is leaving a lace. The scent is kind of "chalky"...like being near a blackboard after erasing it. The taste has a twang of "chalkiness" but there is definitely a caramel typ malt presence that is balancing a bitter hop that carries slight citrus and hint of pine. The mouthfeel is a full body with decent carbonation. Overall it is ok....probably would not buy another six of it.
BEER Pours a dark orange color with two fingers of white head. Smells of sweet caramel with spicy pine and grapefruit. Follows the nose with juicy grapefruit and bitter pine with some caramel malt backing. The mouthfeel is a little weird on this one... it's almost watery, which is strange considering the ABV; has low carbonation. The mouthfeel was a little too much of a distraction to get by on this one.
BEER Yuengling Lager has a unique taste to me and I like it....this beer took off in Central Alabama about eight years ago when it arrived....a friend of mine was able to get this brew for his bar before anyone else and his club became the most popular place to drink overnight....eventually more folks began to offer YGL and it can still be found on tap in a lot of places in Central Alabama.
BEER Yuengling stands out from other big American lagers with its maltier smell and taste. It also seems to have somewhat more of a slight bitter/funky kick. That's all well and good, but personally I don't find this beer that tasty or even that refreshing (as other lagers can be). It's just meh all around, and the fact that I only see it served in ice cold bottles doesn't really do it any favors either.
